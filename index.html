<h1>Who I Am</h1>
<pre>	I never really considered myself an artist. I gave up the idea of a career in engineering and science to follow my passion of creating
video games. To bring about my visions of immersive player experiences, I work in the mediums of 3D modeling, architecture, miniature
painting, and level design. My science background influences my work through a desire for precision and mechanical and biological
realism and accuracy in the pieces I create. I am influenced from European mythologies, typically English, Nordic, Celtic, and Finnish
Mythologies, as well as the occult and creations based on these tales of magic like Warcraft or the works of Tolkien. Another source of
inspiration and influence are the works of H.P. Lovecraft and the elements of cosmic horror based on it in western science fictions like
Star Wars, Starcraft, and superhero movies like the recent Dr. Strange. I am also influenced by the sleek and classic art of James Bond.
Because of my drastic career shift, the stories I wish to tell within the interactive media that I wish to create are centered around a
strong respect for nature and life and a respect for being true to one's self about interests and passions.
