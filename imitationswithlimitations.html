<h1>Imitations with Limitations</h1>
<pre>	This video is a combination of two videos that were shown in a gallery show curated by professor of video art at San Jose
  State University, Lark Buckingham. The two works were shown simultaneously on two iPhone 5 cell phones that were attached to the wall.
  The human one was shown above and the rendered one was shown below on a cracked screen. Cell phones were chosen because they are how
  people view videos most frequently so they don't appear out of place. The crack was placed over the render to show that the machine
  works, but it is still broken. The idea behind the work is that these two videos show a person performing a task and a rendered
  animation performing the same task. The first three, the render does better, but the final three, the human does better. It is about
  machines being awesome and functional but still not perfect.
