    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Sergio Oswald, the man behind the famed software company, Systemsoft was found dead in his London flat moments ago by his maid. It was immediately determined by the coroner that the cause of death was no less than six gunshot wounds to the head. Consequently, Systemsoft stock plummeted today. Oswald was long thought to have connections to the underworld citing himself that his business techniques he learned before his prior jail time in his twenties are what got him to the top of the tech industry today.</p>

      <h5>Patrick Philandros Makes Millions, <span class="w3-opacity">October 16, 2017</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><a href="page8.html">Patrick Philandros</a> was a little known name just this morning, but his recent bid on the stock market just made himself a household name. He made millions bidding against Systemsoft when nobody thought their stock would go anywhere but up. Responding to inquiry he says "It was apparent it would happen soon, no good thing lasts forever and I knew Systemsoft would fall, I just had a hunch it would fall today since today marks the release of their awful new product, the ePhone9++." Oswald goes on to say that the world famed ePhone series is a dried up market and that it was intuition that made him his approximately 115 million USD this morning. </p>

      <h4><b>The Maid's Exposé</b></h4>
      <p>Oswald's Maid, Cynthia Lupe, reveals a life of lavish luxury and back alley underworld dealings going on behind the curtain at Systemsoft. "It was cocktail parties, caviar, chilled champagne, and rolexes one day, and cleaning bloodstains off the porous tile floor the next," reveals Lupe, who has requested to remain anonymous.</p>
