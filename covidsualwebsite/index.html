<h1>Covidsual</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Covidsual is a play-on-words combining Covid-19 with visual and residual. The piece puts marks on your face that an N95 mask would leave after it is taken off. This is a piece that is meaningful only because of recent events. Because masks are becoming a part of a person's daily wear, we live in a time just before masks become fashionable. This is just what a person's face will look like when they get home. This piece means to take part in the conversation, what will remain when Covid-19 has passed? Not just the marks are residual, but what other marks will this global issue leave?</p>
