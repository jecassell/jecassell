<h1>Castle Sculpted (top), Castle Rendered (middle), Castle Final (below).</h1>
<pre>	Here I've taken the Minecraft sculp from the previous project, and extracted it using a program called Mineways, then put into another
program called Meshmixer to weld the shared edges. Finally it was put into a third program called Cura to connect to the Lulzbot 3D printer.
It was then printed, first as a demo piece that took 16 minutes and then as a final piece that took 40 minutes. I then used Warhammer
painting skills I acquired a long time ago to make it look resentable as a rook or a castle chess piece.

	In order to produce this work I made a somewhat symmetrical octagon and built it up four layers while reducing its size inwards by one unit
each, except for the final layer on the top which increases one unit outwards. Each flat edge is ten units long and each jagged edge is also
ten units long at the largest octagon. I had seen other works printed and noticed they all had this layered texture on each side built up and
a striped texture along the top flat parts. I thought this would look great on a cobblestone castle tower because I could work with the medium
instead of having to do cleanup work, the layers look good as stacked stone brick layers and the stripes look good as wooden boards. So I
painted it using different shades and drybrushing to build the layers up, washed it with dark wash, and applied some textured moss paint to
add moss accents with more drybrushing to make them more colorful.

	Thie piece is intended as a functional game piece for a game like Chess or Warhammer. Scaled up it could be an interesting piece of scenery
or part of a ceramic miniature holiday village your well-off aunt or grandma would collect from Michaels craft stores.

	Castles are often seen in fantasy games, movies, and books. As a side note, this is also a sort of homage to my culture. My ancestors were
scottish peasants and built castles and that's how we get the name, Cassell (pronounced 'castle').</pre>
