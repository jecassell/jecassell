<h1>Detritus vs Neatness</h1>
<pre>	This video is an art piece that was intended to be an installation in a gallery. In the gallery the two videos would be in
  a dark room projected onto opposite walls so that the viewer could only see one video at a time. They would be played
  simultaneously, so that the viewer would have to shift their conscious from one state of existence to the other. There is also
  audio that plays, the first part of audio would play next to the poor video and the second would play next to the wealthy video,
  and both would be low volume so that the viewer would have to walk over to the other wall to hear it. This piece is a commentary
  on wealth inequality. The video begins with simple contrats to prime the viewer for the performances they are about to see. Each
  character goes about their night doing tasks typical of the societal caste that they are a part of. The wealthy person does
  affluent things and owns luxury items. In contrast, the poor person drinks Budweiser and owns cheap goods. The camera pans up at
  the end to show that both characters are smiling, indicating that no way of life is better than the other.
