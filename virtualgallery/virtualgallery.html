<p>You don't have to remove your backpack or finish your food before entering. This time, the gallery has been brought to you. This VR space allows you to see Jacob's works in his personal gallery.</p>
<pre style = "font-family: 'Courier New', sans-serif;">Click <a href="../poop.html">here</a> or the welcome above to view the gallery.</pre>
<h3>Work Statement</h3>
<p>The space itself is a work of art. It was created as a statement on the recent societal shift towards acceptance of the legitimacy and necessity of one's digital self.</p>
<p>Each person's digital self is becoming more considered to be a legitimate part of the self and a real piece of self-expression. That is, it is becoming more and more popular to have friends that you have never met in person, instead, only experiencing their digital personas. This space is interesting to consider as Virtual Reality technology gets more advanced. That is not to say we will be seeing less and less of each other, but we will probably see more of the virtual persona of people all around the world that we otherwise would not interact with at all.</p>
<p>This space is a monument to this generation's willingness to accept the possibility of friendship with a digital persona, and to distribute one of their own in turn. With the help of VR tech, you, too, can experience this virtual space as a virtual human, and see works that spur your mind to new ideas.</p>
