<h1>Here is a link to 403 Forbidden. <a href="netart/index.html">403Forbidden.</a></h1>

<pre>	The first page of my website is supposed to appear as though it is a 403 Forbidden error. It's a mockup, there is a way past it. But
the website is a sort of rudimentary game with two possible endings. It is supposed to show the media's connection and involvement with
the shadowy world of spies and espionage. And how people only respond to tragedy, in that the comments on the good results are fewer
than the amount of comments on bad news. Another thing it says is the media's involvement in spinning stories to sound weird and
outlandish for clickbait. It's also made to make you think differently about paying attention to certain aspects of webpages while being
complicated and somewhat immersive with dead ends and a need to remember information or have to go back go find it again. There are also
some comments in the source code.</pre>
