<h1>Minecraft Sculpture Series: Warcraft Plate Helm Icon (above) and Castle (below)</h1>
<pre>	This is an icon from Warcraft III and later World of Warcraft. This icon was one of the more heavily used in both games and people in
the "Warcraft fan" sub-culture might be able to recognize it fairly quickly as the icon for the Revenant class of neutral-hostile enemies,
and often used as an icon for plate mail head armor without a unique icon or model. These kinds of 56x56 pixel icons are used throughout
both games to quickly give players the gist of what an item is or does at a very quick glance. If the player mouses over the icon, they get
further information, but these icons are memes in a way. This one being commonly used to give the player an idea that they have just picked
up a magical plate helmet or, in the earlier game, that they are going to summon a powerful elemental creature. This icon is officially
named "inv_helmet_06."

	The second work is called Castle Sculpted because it was intended for use in another project where it would be 3D printed. This is intended
to resemble a rook or castle chess piece.</pre>
